Question:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Solution-:
for i in range(2000,3200):
    if i%7==0 and i%5!=0:
       print(i,end=",")
Question 2
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320
b=int(input("enter the no which u want to fac"))
c=1
for i in range(1,b+1):
  c=c*i
print(c)
#----------------------------------------#
Question 3
Level 1

Question:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
Solution-:
d1={}
x=int(input("enter the value for the integral"))
for i in range(1,x+1):
  d1[i]=i*i
print(d1)
#----------------------------------------#
Question 4
Level 1

Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
Solution-:
x=[]
for i in range(1,10):
  d=int(input("enter the elements of sequence-:"))
  x.append(d)
print(x)
print(tuple(x))
  
#----------------------------------------#
Question 5
Level 1

Question:
Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.
Hints:
Use __init__ method to construct some parameters

Solution:
class InputOutString(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.s = ""

    def getString(self):
        self.s = raw_input()

    def printString(self):
        print self.s.upper()

strObj = InputOutString()
strObj.getString()
strObj.printString()
